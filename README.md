Programs in Pascal language were written by me as part of the classes during my mathematical studies - Introduction to Computer Science.

# Rozwiazania_rownania_kwadratowego:
The user inputs the coefficients of a general quadratic equation, and the program outputs information about the number of real solutions and their values (exact or approximate).

# Srednia_ocen:
The user inputs the number of grades and their values {1,2,3,4,5,6}, and the program outputs their arithmetic average rounded to two decimal places.

# Snake:
I wrote this program as part of the laboratory exercises in the fundamentals of computer science during my studies. Creating this program allowed me to practically apply the programming concepts I learned and gain skills in algorithms and data structures. This project also helped me better understand the process of creating computer games and applying basic programming techniques in practice.
